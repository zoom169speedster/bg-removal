# 🖼️ BG-Removal

A **full-stack background removal web application** that allows users to upload images, process them with a powerful background removal algorithm, and download the result — all in a simple and intuitive UI.

This project is built with a **Vite + React** frontend (`client`) and a **Node.js + Express** backend (`server`).
